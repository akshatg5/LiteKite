# Frontend Repo for the Litekite Project

Client-side code for  Litekite - an end-to-end mock stock exchange application where users can trade stocks according to real-time prices along with added AI support using the Gemini API.

## Setup

.env : 
```

To run this locally you'll have to setup the litekite backend and run the flask server in your system:
1. Setup the Backend : Github Repo => https://github.com/akshatg5/Finance-CS50  
2. Run the backend server
3. Past the server URL in the .env file
4. Run it like a normal React, Vite project
